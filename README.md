  A very basic calculator. So far it can only handle single-digit whole numbers and the four basic operators. This is the hardest project I've done so far! Took me really long to come up with a system for handling the operator precedence and being able to display the intermediate results while the user is keying in a long equation. Lots of head scratching and flowcharts but it was really fun!
